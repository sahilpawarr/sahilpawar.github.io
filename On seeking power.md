I think the biggest distraction, for me, has historically been seeking power. It's the easiest generic target; at any point, the direction of increasing power is usually obvious. For me, over the last year, it's been abundantly clear that if I want to increase my personal power I should just spend more of my time on Twitter.

[[Power]] is seductive because it is maximally general; seeking power is the ultimate way of saying "I don't know what I want." (and so you look for the meta-ability to get whatever you want, instead of seeking concrete things)

In my experience, as I've come to know what I want, I've started to value power less and less. It's obviously useful to be well-connected, and to be able to convey your ideas and requests to relevant people. But power beyond those basics is the goal of a flat, empty, undeveloped person.

Power is also more expensive than specific abilities in the same way that cash is more valuable than equally-priced gift cards. Optionality comes with a surcharge, and you can avoid paying it entirely by simply refining your desires and interests.
