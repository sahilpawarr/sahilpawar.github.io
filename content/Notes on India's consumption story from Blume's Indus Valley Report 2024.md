### Key Takeaways:
- India's Global Standing: Despite being the world's 5th largest economy, India ranks at No. 140 in GDP per capita, highlighting a significant disparity in wealth distribution.
- #### Consumption-Led Growth:
	- Despite our low per capita income and underconsumption, we have a largish rising ascendant affluent class 
	- Approximately 30 million households are identified as major consumption drivers, spotlighting the potential for targeted economic strategies
	- .The report points out that India's GDP growth is predominantly driven by consumer spending, differentiating it from economies that lean on exports or manufacturing. 
	- India’s economy has long been characterized by high Private Consumption, i.e., spends by households, private sector and government, as a high share of the GDP. 
- The key reason for this is Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCP) has a far lower share than it should; primarily because of underinvestment. 
	- _(GFCF is essentially creation of productive assets such as machinery, infrastructure. It's a key indicator of long-term economic growth as it reflects the productive capacity of an economy)_ 
- #### So why does India underinvest in GFCP?
	- India’s GFCP has been averaging approximately 28% in the last since FY2001. Comparatively, China has stayed above 40%
	- The main reason for this is underperformance of private players to reach the growth they potentially could have reached in the last 20 years.. Their stagnated/slow growth is primarily because they are borrowing less money as corporate debt than they earlier used to.

- #### So why are private companies not borrowing like before?
	- The answer is low capital utilization. What does this mean?
	- Low capital utilisation occurs when existing capital assets are not fully utilized to their potential, leading to inefficiencies in the economy, as resources are underutilized, and businesses may refrain from making new investments or expanding operations.

-  **Rise in unsecured loans and NPAs
	- While a rise in personal loans, particularly unsecured ones, can stimulate short-term economic activity, a significant portion of these loans turning into Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) can pose risks to financial stability.
	- ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kEJeQb7Zt9ai9RedRDHzXQ9eI52F9C-icx4nyfAqWdbWcAScuH-o4ujMIYtJ6vl7H-nW9qwEPPpxC27acr7s28u3tSCPekIw934HsP3eFhCCBB3L3_LP1GCFvgGFQU9DKb638ZjtBywERgLY6hp0ngg)
	- When NPAs rise, banks may become cautious about lending, leading to a credit crunch and reduced investment in the economy, and unsecured lending that’s on the rise just exacerbates the risks.
	- ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3wZy8WsLMCcENxYSrUB6Bz1FyrvbSELRUX6R_fCH-BQGrwRTJbxpMRUJE4Ev1RTPGZ0V3SIt4yy7gtt8fYvq7YsqAWxVbueN_VnEZTEMAJWCymLG02hw8_31McemhTug0WKDh1DhL6j37HIUVxMXB9c)
	- Unsecured lending alongside rising NPAs would create financial instability and eventually tighten credit. It would further reduce consumption and investment.
	- Reduced investment and consumption, along with financial sector stress, can lead to a slowdown in overall economic growth as businesses cut back on expansion plans and consumers reduce spending amid uncertainty.
	- 
- #### Taxation Insights:
- India’s tax collection growth has not been watertight enough to support the ambitious capex investment projects that India could be pursing
- This is because: 
	- India’s tax to GDP ratio hasn’t moved in the past 7 years; it collects far less tax than its peers.
	- Only 1.5% of Indians contribute to the nation's income tax, underscoring the narrow tax base in contrast to the population size.

- Positive Future Outlook: The report also presents an optimistic view of the growing consumption class, suggesting steady economic expansion ahead.

### Some of the ‘Aha’ moments I had while reading the report: 

- ###### Despite the dramatic run up in stock markets, the TOTAL market cap of all listed companies is smaller than the market cap of just two US companies!!!
- ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jSrjOMfuyGXQJkeb8m0qI6buxd7rFCJ89mSALzEiQ399PdF8y10Jpcvi7Qyuryin6Rs7cZqnGzpSMhgSAWKkDaR5YN5FGCpTRNrKjFz-dUXGWe2fo3L6xeZWu-VtPBXtlUU6EAZwzLZnWYTvEkZkT5E)

- ###### Though there has been a lot of talk of unicorns and gang-buster IPO’s, 77% of listed companies trade at a valuation below Rs. 2000 crores. Takeaway: huge upside potential.

- ###### The mutual fund AUM in india leapfrogged from 8 trillion USD to 50 trillion USD in the last 10 years.
- ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ksFJd8QGzDRGVzzyosZkBGjPr0JbiRgalObj09ri96CXarVPoNvRUFWYHL3Y08dp6YMlpfx5d9WaW7gknb7R8JXphuHhjOyL4UQ5yEt9wtbU9KUwW3Xj-0sgIOgxab_2ryuTaxPiOoSCix8lPLZd8fY)
- ###### Another data point reinforcing something I've spoken earlier - low investment in R&D in India 
- Couple of key takeaways 
	- Business enterprises invest least in R&D. Largely government spending. Presumably the perception is that the ROI on R&D is not adequate!!!
	- Very few people take up research as a career in India. Again presumably because of limited upward mobility.
