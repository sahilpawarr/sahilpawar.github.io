Tell me about your current job

So I work as a Founder's Office Associate at Cambridge Wealth. 

Cambridge Wealth is a fintech startup focused in the wealth management space for high networth individuals. 

In the most basic sense of things --  Cambridge Wealth helps build portfolios for their clients and assist them in their financial freedom journey

My role at Cambridge Wealth was to work as a Chief of Staff to the Founder. 

So I worked directly with the CEO on various key strategic business initiatives, many of them I led independently. 

At my time here, I have worked on 
- Equity Research and Investment Modelling
- Stakeholder Management and Strategic partnerships
- Business Strategy and Planning

So we as a startup function in various departments -- the Business, the Technology and the Research Team. My job essentially is to work at the intersection of these teams. 

Started off as a team of 4 folks and has now scaled to roughly a 40 people team
