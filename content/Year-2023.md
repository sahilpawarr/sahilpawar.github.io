[[Yearly review]]

### things i am proud of accomplishing this year

- graduated college
- bagged an off campus role at a fintech startup which i didnt apply for
- bought myself a really beautiful bike with my own money
- invested for the first time 
- bought my parents gifts with my salary 
- took working out a bit more seriously and started looking not as skinny as earlier
- spent alot of good quality time with my girlfriend
- learnt alot about life out in the real world, learnt how i actually dont know half the things i thought i knew and neither did i liked the things i thought i liked.
- got promoted at work (although I resigned 2 weeks after this this is still an accomplishment in my eyes lol)
- played football on most weekends


### also, some things im not proud of:
- not talking enough about my problems to people
- not grieving enough and bursting out of my emotions all at once
- being too recluse and stayed distant from my friends (sometimes)
- getting bored of things too quickly and looking outwards and not inwards for answers
- been terminally online on twitter
- read significantly less compared to what i used to read
- not sleeping enough

this year has been a emotional roller coaster tbh but fuck it we ball onto the next one
