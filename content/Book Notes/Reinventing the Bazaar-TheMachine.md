## What do we mean by “a market”? 
A market for something exists if there are people who want to buy it and people who want to sell it. The dictionary defines a market as “a meeting together of people for the purpose of trade by private purchase and sale,” and “a public place where a market is held.”4 This does not go deep enough, though. 

## What characterizes a market transaction?
- Decision-making autonomy is key. Participation in the exchange is voluntary; both buyer and seller are able to veto any deal. They are separate entities. Controlling their own resources, the participants in a market, in deciding how those resources are to be used, are not obliged to follow others’ orders. They are free to make decisions—to buy, to sell, to exert effort, to invest—that reflect their own preferences. Their choices are not completely free though: they are constrained by the extent of their resources and by the rules of the marketplace.

- If people lack autonomy, then their dealings are not, by this definition, market dealings. Where an authority relationship exists—one party is in charge of the other, or a higher authority is in charge of them both—then any transactions are of some other category; they are not market transactions.

- Competition, while not a defining feature of a market, is usually present and adds to the autonomy. Competition curbs any individual participant’s power and, in most markets, prevents anyone from having a decisive effect on overall outcomes. A consumer can say, “No, I’ll shop elsewhere.” A competitive market means that alternatives exist.

- A definition of a market transaction, then, is an exchange that is voluntary: each party can veto it, and (subject to the rules of the marketplace) each freely agrees to the terms. A market is a forum for carrying out such exchanges.


  
Exchange is “one of the purest and most primitive forms of human socialization,” the sociologist Georg Simmel wrote in 1900; it creates “a society, in place of a mere collection of individuals.”
