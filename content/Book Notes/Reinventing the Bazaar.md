## What do we mean by “a market”? 
A market for something exists if there are people who want to buy it and people who want to sell it. The dictionary defines a market as “a meeting together of people for the purpose of trade by private purchase and sale,” and “a public place where a market is held.”4 This does not go deep enough, though. 

## What characterizes a market transaction?
- Decision-making autonomy is key. Participation in the exchange is voluntary; both buyer and seller are able to veto any deal. They are separate entities. Controlling their own resources, the participants in a market, in deciding how those resources are to be used, are not obliged to follow others’ orders. They are free to make decisions—to buy, to sell, to exert effort, to invest—that reflect their own preferences. Their choices are not completely free though: they are constrained by the extent of their resources and by the rules of the marketplace.

- If people lack autonomy, then their dealings are not, by this definition, market dealings. Where an authority relationship exists—one party is in charge of the other, or a higher authority is in charge of them both—then any transactions are of some other category; they are not market transactions.

- Competition, while not a defining feature of a market, is usually present and adds to the autonomy. Competition curbs any individual participant’s power and, in most markets, prevents anyone from having a decisive effect on overall outcomes. A consumer can say, “No, I’ll shop elsewhere.” A competitive market means that alternatives exist.

- A definition of a market transaction, then, is an exchange that is voluntary: each party can veto it, and (subject to the rules of the marketplace) each freely agrees to the terms. A market is a forum for carrying out such exchanges.




Left to themselves, markets can fail. To deliver their full benefits, they need support from a set of rules, customs, and institutions. They cannot operate efficiently in a vacuum. If the rules of the market game are inadequate, as often they are, it is difficult and time-consuming to set them right. Many countries, to their citizens’ detriment, have not yet been able to do so. 

Markets are not miraculous. There are problems they cannot address. If their platform is unsound, they do not even solve the problems they are supposed to solve. Viewed as tools, markets need not be revered or reviled—just allowed to operate where they are useful.

While markets can do a lot, they do not work automatically. Unaided, the market will not take care of things


Markets are resilient; a refugee camp or a prison camp may seem improbable locations for a thriving market system. Markets generate gains from trade; one of the most important observations in all of economics is that buying and selling creates value. The Rwandan refugees focused their labor. Some scavenged meat, others grew vegetables; some gathered firewood, others worked as tailors or cooks. Then they traded what they produced. In the prison camp, nonsmokers sold cigarettes to buy food, while vegetarian Indians exchanged canned beef for jam and margarine.
