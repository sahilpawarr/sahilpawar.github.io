I've noticed when I am meeting someone new and they introduce themselves, it is somehow always centred around the work that they do. How is "I'm a software engineer at XYZ company " the answer to a tell me about yourself question. Even I do this alot of times. 

Is our work supposed to be a means to an end or is it our life itself? Isn't our career an answer to "what do you do for a living" and not "tell me about yourself"? 

Recently while candidly talking to an extremely wealthy client who's money my company manages, he said how the biggest mistake I can make in my life is to think that I am supposed to work to earn money so that I can spend it. Instead the focus should be on earning money to buy myself time. 

Another point to add here is that I've seen alot of people get financially free and retire in their 40s. But  they can't actually "retire" from work even though they have "bought" the time to not work by working earlier in their careers. because their entire personality was their work

I'm not questioning the importance of earning money or the exponential significance having money has on your life

Bottom line is that no amount of monetory gains can sadly make up for time itself. Ik this is pretty cliche and not some extraordinary piece of wisdom here, but my inherent quest over the last 16 months to find purpose in the work I do and the impact I leave on this planet via my existence has led me to believe that you got to live life when you can live it doing what you drives you everyday
