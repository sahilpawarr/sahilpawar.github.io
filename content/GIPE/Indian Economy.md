### Demonitisation 5 Years On
- November 6, 2016 : Demonitisation happened to weed out black momey out of the economy.
- Currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 demonitised, wiping out 86% of India's currency overnight
- Currency with the public which stood at Rs17.97 trillion at the time, declined sharply to Rs. 7.8 trillion in January 2017, soon after demonitisation
- Of the 15.41 trillion that was demonitised, 15.31 trillion came back to RBI
- So, more than 99% of the demonitised currency notes were returned to the banking system

### 5 Key Indicators

1) **Cash Still Rules**: 
	1) all time high of Rs. 28.3 trillion, 57% higher than pre-demonetisation
	2) As a percentage of GDP, cash in circulation has jumped from 8.17 in FY17 to 14.7% in FY21
	
2) **Digital Transactions**:   These, including UPI, have also touched an all-time high
3)  **No. of UPI Transactions** Up from just 0.29 million in Nov 2016 to 4.2 billion now
4)  **Value of UPI Transactions** A record high of $103 billion in Oct 2021
5)   **Currency in Circulation**  The currency in circulation has been growing in line with nominal GDP growth.

### Other Imp Points:
1) Informal sector contracted from 52% of GDP three years ago to 15-20% in FY21. Although the pandemic caused most of this transformation as the informal economy was the worst hit, some of it has been due to demonetisation and the implementation of GST.
2) One of the obj of demonitisation was deducing dependence on high value notes. But acc to RBI, the 500 and 2000 notes in terms of volume have tose to 33.1% from 9.2% in 3 years

 ## Demonitisation: One Step Forward, Two Steps back
- In a country like India, corruption seeps virtually into every service of society, fighting black money and its continous generation should be a major task for any givt
- Corruption not only harrasses the common man but also prevents fruitful development as even the smallest of pojects get derailed with most of the allocations swallowed by politicians, bureaucrats and middemen
- Without doubt it India has to come out of its backwardness and excruciating impoverishment, fighting black money and corruption is essential

**Can Demonitisation overcome this problem**
- Ferriting out the existing stock of black money cannot be a one time act
- An equally important task is the prevention of its regeneration in the future
- Ironically, printing high denominations of 2000 notes will actually increase black money in circulation

**Cash Stock: Tip of the iceberg**
- According to NIPFP, Dec 2013, black money could constitute to 75% of India's GDP. However this number was ignored
- Media also blacked out, choosing to quote the World Bank estimates of black money/economy a mere 20-30% of GDP

**Counterfiet currency**
- As for fake notes, the amout of counterfeit currency siezed between 2012 and 2015 was merelly 147cr
- In 2015, study by ISI estimated fake currency in circulation to be just Rs400cr (ie. mere 0.022% of total circulation)
- However, the Home Minister reiterated this figure on 18th Nov 2016 and added that a mere Rs 28Cr of fake notes were confiscated in 2016 and just 70Cr of fake currency notes were pumped into the economy every year
- Even if the govt claimed that the number was 100 times larger, it would still constitute to 1% of the total money demonetised

**Cashless Economy**
- Less than 50% of households dont have a back account, over 60% household of our economy is in the informal sector and depend on cash
- In india, barely 3 million people file for income tax and 2 million pay tax
- India has a cash to GDP ratio of 12%, compared to the world avg of 4%

**Untold Suffering and Chaos**
- 500 rupee notes were not ready 5 days after demonitisation
- only 2000 in supply so people didnt have short cash to buy daily food/supplies
- RBI could have ensured that 100 rupee notes are enough in circulation and also made sure that the new notes had the same weight and size as the old notes so that new ATMs wouldny be necessary, as caliberation of new ATMs didnt start till a week after the announcement
- No proper preperation was done for this, the govt inititially said it will be restored in 50 days but it took well over 6 months to bring normalcy back
- Demontisation resulted in damage of people's lives and also disruption in informal sector
- Queues were long and took hours, most people had to return with no cash
- Daily wage workers had to leave work and stand in lines
- Bank employees were harrassed and also had to work long hours to meet the demands 
- Retailers and farmers were not able to sell their goods/crop since customers didnt have cash to buy it. That year's ready khariff crop was more or less wasted



UMA KAPILA

- Development Economics suggests that development is a three stage process. 
- The dominance of the service sector in the growth process is usually associated with the third stage of growth
- During the 1980s and 1990s services accounted for a share of about 70% of GDP in industrialised countries and about 50% in developing countries
- In India, growth of services picked up in the 80s and accelerated in the 90s, when it averaged abut 7.5% per annum, thus providing an impetus to industry and agriculture, which grew on average by 5.8% and 3.1% respectively


Growth and Sectoral Shares 

---

- For higher education, the commission had drawn up a long-term enrolment plan. 
 - Based on calculation done team of ISI and LSE
 - The entire economy was divided into a number of sectors. It was assumed that as net output in each sector and in each branch of manufacturing increases, so proportionately will the employment of educated manpower in the country. 
 - The pattern of employment in 1961 was taken as base, and manpower requirement were worked out on the basis of proportional growth of manpower and sectoral outputs. 
 - Requirement of educated manpower in case of services was worked out on arbitrary norms, such as number of doctors per thousand population, teacher-pupil ratios or assumed growth rates.
- Main purpose of higher education was to meet the need of qualified people in the economy, without the intention of undermining civic/societal role of higher education


The political forces and electoral compulsions that guided policy on higher education have become stronger overtime
Interests of academic communities which saw opportunity of personal advancement through the expansion of higher education have been joined by private promoters of higher education who see big money in this field

- Demand for higher education contines to grow because of growing middle class and their ambitious aspirations
- HIgher education enrolement has grown by more than 100 times in last 60 years
- Despite poor labour market for graduates in 70s and 80s, demand for higher education continues
- In the 1980s, growth was largely through private investments, private ed grew rapidly after that
- In almost all professional courses 80% enrolment is in private institutions
- projected enrollment for 2006 was 12.82 million
