## What is elasticity?
Elasticity is the measure of responsiveness to quanitity demanded to price change.


## Elasticity of Demand

The elasticity of demand states by how much does quantity demanded change when price changes

A demand curve is said to be elastic when an increase in price reduces the quantity demanded but **a lot**.

A demand curve is said to be inelastic when when the same increase in price reduces the price just by a little

### How elastic a demand curve is depends roughly on the following factors

-   **Availability of Substitutes**
    
    -   The availability of subsitutes stongly infulences the sensitivity of quantity demanded to change in price. For goods with many subsitutes switching branfs when price fluctuates is easy. Here the demand is elastic
    -   . On the other hand if Crocin Tablets increase their prices, people can always choose to buy Combiflam tablets instead or any other alternative pain killer tablet. This availability of subsitutes makes the demand elastic
    -   For goods with fewer substiutes consumers find it hard to adjust to the quantity demanded evem when price changes. Here the demand is inelastic
-   **Time Horizon**
    
    -   The time horizon influences the elasticity of demand for a good.
    -   If the price of a commodity does up immediatly without any prior notice, consumers may not be able to alter their consumption patterns. This is inelastic demand
    -   If the price of a commodity goes up over a period of time the consumers can adjust their behaviors and find subsitutes for it. This makes it elastic demand.
    -   If the price of oil goes up in a short notice, people will still but oil as they cant stop driving cars. But if this takes place over a period of time and the price continous going up in the ling run people make think of subsutiing this by buying smaller cars, mopeds or electric/solar vehicles. In an even longer run if the price of oil stays low people will change the way cities are planned and prefer staying closer to their place of work to avoid commute.
-   **Necessity vs Luxury**
    
    The nature of the good to the consumer can affect the elasticity of demand
    
    For necessity consumers do not change quantity even when price changes.(inelastic)
    
    For luxuries consumers wil alter their behaviour when the price rises(elastic)
    
    For example for someone drinking coffee in the morning is a necessity. Even of the price of the coffee goes up it doesnt affect their purchase of coffee. On the other hand for someone who doesnt consume coffee on a daily basis but occasionally, the ncrease in the price affects his purchase and he might opt for a subsitute in say, tea instead. This factor changes from person to person as ones needs and tastes is not the same for every one.
    
-   **Size of the Purchase**
    
    -   How large the size of the purchase is relative to the overall consumer's budget influences the elasticity of demand.
    -   It it is too small the change in price will go unnotices. Ex: 50% increase in toothpaste price.(inelastic)
    -   If it is too big, the change in price will be noticed and make the demand elastic. Ex: 25% increase in car prices

### Cross Price Elasticity

-   The cross elasticity of demand is an economic concept that measures the responsiveness in the quantity demanded of one good when the price for another good changes.
-   The cross elasticity of demand for substitute goods is always positive because the demand for one good increases when the price for the substitute good increases.
-   Alternatively, the cross elasticity of demand for complementary goods is negative.
