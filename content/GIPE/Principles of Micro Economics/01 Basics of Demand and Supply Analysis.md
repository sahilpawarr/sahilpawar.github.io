# Session 3: Basics of Demand and Supply Analysis: Principles of Economics
---
### Demand Curve:
-   The quantity demanded increases as the price gets lower
-   Example of oil at $55, 5 million oil barrels demanded while at $5 40million barrels demanded
-   When oil prices are relatively low the oil that is being demanded is used for low value and high value goods alike.
-   As and when the price increases so does the price of making these low value goods,thus reducing the demand. For these consumers the benefit of buying these low value goods is too little compared to the price it costs

### Law of Demand
The law of demand states that there is a negative, or inverse, relationship between price and the quantity of a good demanded and its price.
This means that demand curves slope downward

 ### Factors affecting a shift in demand
-  #### Income	
 A poor student might eat at McDonalds but when he graduates and gets a high paying job he may eat at a better restaurant. Thus the demand for McDonalds decreases and fine dining increases due to Income
- #### Population
As the population of an economy changes the number of buyers also changes thus directly affecting demand.
-  #### Price of Substitutes
Two goods are subisitutes of the increase in the price of one good leads to the increase in the demand of the other good.
If price of Nike shoes goes up the demand for Adidas goes up.
The demand for iTunes is lower as Spotify is cheaper
- #### Price of Complements
-Complements are goods that go hand in hand with each other. If the price of one goes up consequnntly the demand of the other goes down
If the price of petrol goes up the demand of cars will be less as people will start preferring public transport for commute to avoid spending extra in a longer run.
- #### Expectations
If people expect the price of a good to be higher in the future it is going to tend to increase in demand today
For example when government announces the price hike for petrol from next week there is an increase in the demand of petrol this week as people tend to store petrol to get it at a relatively cheaper price

##### What are Veblen goods?
-  Veblen good is a good for which demand increases as the price increases, because of its exclusive nature and appeal as a status symbol
-  A Veblen goodÂ has an upward-sloping demand curve which runs counter to the typical downward-sloping curve.
-  Examples are yachts, luxury watches, sports cars

##### What are Giffen Goods?  (still havent understood this properly)
- usually low income non luxury products
- Demand for Giffen goods rises when the price rises and falls when the price falls.
- Leads to an upward slopping demand curve

--- 
### Supply Curve
-   The Supply Curve shows how much goods sellers will supply at different prices
-   For an example of oil at $5 10 million barrels are supplied, at $20 25million barrels are supplied and at $55 50million are supplied
-   When oil prices are relatively low the only suppliers who can turn a profit are the ones who get the oil cheaply, like Saudi Arabia. As the price gets higher other extractors like Nigeria and Russia who have higher extraction costs come into the market as they can now make profit.
-   Thus if the prices go high the supply will rise as there is a higher margin for gaining profit.## Law of Supply
 - The law of supply states that there is a positive relationship between price and quantity of a good supplied.
- This means that supply curves typically have a positive slope.

### Factors affecting Supply
- #### Technological Innovation
   Technological innovations lowers the production costs thus increasing supply, which measn the seller is willing to sell more quantity at the same price
    
-  #### Input Prices
   For example if the government was to increase rules and regulations fo petrol, the supply of petrol woould go down which would result in increase of costs
