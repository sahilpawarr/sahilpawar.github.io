 To use an analogy, The Production function is a toaster which makes bread into toast. The variables in this case are the total number of bread slices, time it takes for a bread to toast in the toaster, and the time it takes for a person to toast a bread.

 #### Total Production:
 Total production as the name suggests determines the total production of the item wrt to the variable, in this case , labour.

#### Marginal Increase in Production :
Marginal Produce is the increase in produce which happens with the increase in variable, in this case labour. So if one worker makes 10 toasts and two of them make 18, <b>10-18=8</b> becomes the marginal increase in production.

#### Average Increase in Production:
Total production divided by the variable

## Fixed Cost, Variable Cost and Marginal Cost.
![[Pasted image 20210408163559.png]]
 #### Average Fixed Cost:
 - AFC= Fixed Cost/variable(Code)
 - Decreases with increase in variable
 
 #### Average Variable Cost:
 - AVC= Var. Cost/variable
 - Increases with increase in variable
 
 #### Marginal Cost:
 -  (Difference of costs)/(difference if variables)
 - Cost of having an extra coder(variable)
