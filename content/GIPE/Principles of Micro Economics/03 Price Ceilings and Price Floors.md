## Price Ceilings
Maximum price allowed by law. Its alled a ceiling because you cant go above that price.

##### Five Important Effects
- **Shortages**
- **Reductions in product quality**
		 (*to manage the cost that has been cut*)
		 		Examples: Books printed in lower quality, cars with fewer coats of paint
- **Wasteful lines and other search costs**
- **A loss in gains from trade**
- **A misallocation of resources**

When a price ceiling is initiated, market equilibrium isnt gained and the supply of the quantity of the commodity is reduced and the demand increases. 
As its illegal to raise the price the price is stalled at the ceiling and thus the demand increases.
Shortage is defined as the difference between demanded quantity (QD) and supplied quantity (SD)


### Rent Control

-   Rent control is a price ceiling on rents set by the government.
    
-   Rent control in Paris after World War I created a housing shortage.
    
-   The shortage would have been eliminated if rents had been allowed to rise to $17 per month.
