##### Factor Intensity
1. given that X,Y and K, L ; 
		 	if, K/L used in the production of Y is greater than that for production of X 
			then, Y is capital intensive and X is labour intensive
##### Factor Abundance
1)  if Tk/TL of Nation 2 is bigger than Nation 1, Nation 2 is capital abundant
2) if Pk/PL of Nation 2 is smaller than Nation 1, Nation 2 is capital abundant

##### what happens if, for whatever reason, the relative price of capital falls. 
Producers would substitute capital for labor in the production of both commodities to minimize their costs of production. As a result, both commodities would become more K intensive. However, only if K/L in the production of commodity Y exceeds K/L in the production of commodity X at all possible relative factor prices can we say unequivocally that commodity Y is the K-intensive commodity

##### Shape of Frontier 
production frontier for Nation 1 that is relatively flatter and wider than the production frontier of Nation 2 (if we measure X along the horizontal axis).

##### Assumptions
1. 2x2x2
2. same technology in production.
3.  X is labor intensive, and Y is capital intensive 
4. produced under constant returns to scale 
5. incomplete specialization in production 
6. Tastes are equal
7. perfect competition in both commodities and factor markets 
8. perfect factor mobility within each nation but no international factor mobility.
9. no external cost to obstruct free flow of international trade (transport, tariff etc)
10. All resources available
11. International trade between the two nations is balanced.

#### Defination:
A nation will export the commodity whose production requires the
intensive use of the nation’s relatively abundant and cheap factor and import the commodity whose production requires the intensive use of the nation’s relatively scarce and expensive factor.

##### Imp Points:
1) Helps link a country's pattern of trade to its endowment of factors of production
2) if your country is relatively capital abundant then your countey has a comparative adv in production of capital intensive goods
	if your country is relatively labour abundant then your countey has a comparative adv in production of labour intensive goods

## Factor Prize Equlization Theorem
1. International trade will bring about equalization in the relative and absolute returns to homogeneous factors across nations
2. What this means is that international trade will
- cause the wages of homogeneous labor to be the same in all trading nations
- cause homogenous capital to be same in all nations

3. international trade causes w to rise in Nation 1 (the low-wage nation) and to fall in Nation 2 (the high-wage nation). Thus, international trade reduces the pretrade difference in w between the two nations.
4. Similarly, international trade causes r to fall. In Nation 1 (the K-expensive nation) and to rise in Nation 2 (the K-cheap nation), thus reducing the pretrade difference in r between the two nations. This proves that international trade tends to reduce the pretrade difference in w and r between the two nations.

## Stopler Samuelson
If Price of x  increased, to produce more x we would need more of the factor being used to produce x (ie labour)
Conversely, price of factor of production which is not being used intensively (K) will fall

## The Rybczynski Theorem
1. At constant commodity prices, an increase in the endowment of one factor will increase by a greater proportion the output of the commodity intensive in that factor and will reduce the output of the other commodity. 
2. For example, if only L grows in Nation 1, then the output of commodity X (the L-intensive commodity) expands more than proportionately, while the output of commodity Y (the K-intensive commodity) declines at constant PX and 

### **Some of the major factors affecting the terms of trade are as follows:**
1. Reciprocal Demand
2. Changes in Factor Endowments
3. Changes in Technology
4. Changes in Tastes
5. Economic Growth
6. Tariff
7. Devaluation
