## Ultimatum Game: 
The Ultimatum Game is a classic experiment used in economics and psychology to study decision making in a social context. In this game, two participants are involved - the proposer and the responder. The experiment starts with the proposer being given a sum of money, for example $100, and then being asked to make a proposal on how to divide the money between themselves and the responder. The responder then decides whether to accept or reject the proposal.

If the responder accepts the proposal, both participants receive the amounts of money specified by the proposer. If the responder rejects the proposal, both participants receive nothing. The key feature of the Ultimatum Game is that the responder has the power to veto the proposal and thereby punish the proposer if they believe the proposal to be unfair.

The Ultimatum Game provides insights into how individuals make decisions in a social context where self-interest is not the only consideration. Most proposers in the Ultimatum Game make a proposal that splits the money roughly equally between themselves and the responder, as they recognize that a more unequal split is likely to be rejected. Responders typically reject proposals that they perceive as unfair, even if it means that both participants will receive nothing.

The results of the Ultimatum Game have been used to support a variety of theories about decision making and social behavior, including theories of fairness, altruism, and reciprocal behavior. The game has also been used to explore the impact of cultural and economic factors on decision making. The Ultimatum Game remains a popular experiment in the fields of economics, psychology, and neuroscience, and continues to provide valuable insights into how individuals make decisions in social settings.
