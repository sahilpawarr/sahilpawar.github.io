[[John Stuart Mill]]

- Utilitarianism maintains that you can judge weather an action is morally write or wrong  by the amounts of net pleasure or pain it produces.
- Basically, to understand what we should do morally, we should know how to judge our actions
- So, an action is right if it tends to produce happiness, and wrong if it tends to produce sadness
