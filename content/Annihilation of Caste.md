### [[Why social reform is necessary for political reform]]

 - Ambedkar's debate is centered around whether social reform, particularly the eradication of caste-based discrimination and societal inequalities, should precede political reform or vice versa. 
 - The Social Conference, which focused on social reform, faced a decline in influence as many preferred political advancements. 
 - Ambedkar's main message is that both social and political reform are essential and interconnected, emphasizing that societal issues must be urgently addressed alongside political reforms to create a just and equitable society. 
 - "Emancipation of the mind and soul is necessary preliminary for the political expansion of the people"

Annotations: 
- Under the rule of the Peshwas in the Maratha country, the untouchable was not allowed to use the public streets if a Hindu was coming along, lest he should pollute the Hindu by his shadow. 
- The untouchable wwas required o have a black thread either on his wrist or in his neck as a sign or a mark to prevent the Hindus from getting themselves polluted by touch
- In Poona, untouchables were forced to cary a broom strung at their waist to sweep away from behind the dust after having walked on that route, incase a Hindu walks there later it need not be polluted.
- In Pune, the untouchable was required to carry an earthen pot hung in the neck for holing th spit falling on the ground to avoid a Hindu from getting polluted if hs's walking down that route. 
- Balais were prohibited to pass through fields owned by a Hindu, so if a field of a Balais was surrounded by fields owned by Hindus, Balais could have no access to his own field. 
- And why was this murderous assault committed on defenseless untouchables? The reason for this is that the untouchable host was imprudent enough to serve ghee to his untouchable guests and they were foolish enough to consume it. In this case even if you could afford the ghee, it still was a mark of social status which wasnt bearable by Hindus
- Every Congress man who repeats the dogma of [[John Stuart Mill]] that one country is not fit to rule another country must admit that one class is not fit to rule another class

### Why social reform is necessary for economic reform
- Socialists believe that property is the only source of power 
- Socialists believe that political and social reforms are illusions and only economic reforms by equalisation of property are important 
- This cant be accepted as social status becomes more imp for holding authority - think millionares obeying penniless Fakirs and Sadhus
- In India, religion being the only source of power is illustrated  in the history of the country where a saint holds greater importance to a common man over the magistrate would. Anything and everything in india for this reason can be given a religious twist.

### Caste is not a division of labour, it's a division of labourers

### Caste cannot preserve non-existent racial purity
- Caste system does not demarcate radial division, it's a social division of people from the same race
