Hello Paul,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Sahil, a recent economics graduate from Pune, India. I've been following your work for a while and have been captivated by your contributions to addressing development related challenges through the Development Data Labs. 

Since graduating in April 2023, I've been working as an analyst at a wealth management company, gaining valuable insights into financial landscapes. However, in the past few months, I've experienced a profound realization that my true calling lies in making a positive impact that extends beyond managing wealth for the rich and I feel a strong pull towards wanting to work for a greater good. 

A few weeks ago I connected with Archana Prabhakar on LinkedIn and we spoke briefly about her work at DDL and the steep learning curve she's been through while working on an impactful project. 

This intrigued me with curiousity to know more about your work at DDL, especially in projects related to poverty and intergenerational mobility. The use of open-source economic data to understand and address development related issues in India aligns with the kind of meaningful contribution I aspire to make.

I'd be grateful if I was considered for a role as a researcher at Development Data Labs. To learn from experienced researchers such as you, Sam Asher and others at DDL would help me get great perspective on economics and data, and even more so help me contribute towards a meaningful impact while doing something I love. 

If you have some time, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you for a brief chat. Your guidance would be immensely valuable irrespective of whether an opportunity exists for me at the moment.

Links to my CV, transcript, writing sample, code sample as well as links to my substack blog where I write to develop my ideas publicly can be found below. 

Thank you!
