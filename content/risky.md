disclaimer this post is not about my bike. on that note, January 2023 i bought this bike. this was my first real purchase with my money. i remember being too proud of myself when i rode it for the first time. pehli baar thoda freeing laga. i think because khud ke dam par kuch kiya tha mene. its been a year now since then and just as a retrospect i realised how drastically my life has changed in this year. bike ke baad khud ke dam pe job bhi mil gaya off campus.
