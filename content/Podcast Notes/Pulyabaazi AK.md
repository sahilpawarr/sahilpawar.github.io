 ## selfishness vs self interest
 - self interest is thinking about yourself and your well being
 - selfishness is thinking about your well bieng an only about your well being and not caring about well being of others
 - example: driving in your own lane to reach destination is self interest becasue u are going to where you need to. driving on the wrong side of the road to reach quicker is selfishness because it involves hampering others on the road.

## Free market
1st Jan drunk and want to go home, book a cab but 3x the price, angry and frustrated cursing the system and thinking of how price cap is necessary. But the cab driver is himself on duty at 4am in the morning instead of partying out just because he wants to earn this extra cash. price cap will be problematic here because it will result in one section of the model - supply being suppressed.
