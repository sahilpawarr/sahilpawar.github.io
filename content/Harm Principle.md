[[John Stuart Mill]] It's the idea that individual freedom should be limited only to prevent harm to others. Here's a more in-depth explanation

1. **Individual Autonomy: 
	1. He believed that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices about their lives, as long as those choices do not harm others. 
	2. This means that people should be able to decide how they want to live, what they want to believe, and what they want to do, even if their choices are different from what others might consider right or moral.
    
2. **Preventing Harm**: 
	1. The key point is that personal freedom is not absolute. It has limits. 
	2. Mill argued that the only legitimate reason for limiting someone's freedom is to prevent harm to others. 
	3. In other words, you can do as you please until your actions start to hurt or endanger someone else.
    
3. **What Constitutes Harm**: 
	1. Mill's definition of harm is quite broad. 
	2. It's not just physical harm but also includes actions that can cause emotional or social harm. 
	3. For example, spreading false information that harms someone's reputation can be seen as causing harm under the Harm Principle.
    
4. **The Role of the State**: 
	1. According to Mill, the state (government) has a right to step in and limit an individual's freedom when their actions cause harm to others. This is the only valid reason for [[government intervention]] in personal liberties. 
	2. The state's role is to ensure that people can enjoy their freedoms without hurting others.
    
5. **Protection Against Tyranny**: 
	1. Mill introduced the Harm Principle as a way to protect individuals from the potential tyranny of the majority. 
	2. He was concerned that a majority could use its power to oppress and silence minority voices. 
	3. By limiting state intervention to cases of harm, he sought to protect the rights of all individuals, including those with unpopular or unconventional views.
    

In essence, the Harm Principle is a cornerstone of Mill's philosophy of liberty. It balances individual autonomy with the need to protect society from harm, ensuring that individuals can make their own choices, express their opinions, and live as they wish, so long as they do not harm others in the process.
