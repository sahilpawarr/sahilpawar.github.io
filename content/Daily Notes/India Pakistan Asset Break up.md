[[Indian Public Finance]]


Creating India and Pakistan as two sovereign nation-states involved a division of governmental staff, properties, records of civil departments, armed forces, financial  settlements, marking out the separate jurisdiction of the high courts and federal courts, charting out domicile policies and, of course, demarcation of boundaries.

The real work of partition—the division of assets and liabilities—began in an atmosphere marked by a heightened sense of religious nationalism and aggressive communal sentiments. There was—as could be expected—widespread public apprehension: what should be the basis of this division, which assets should be divided and what was too unique to split, how fair the entire process would be and so on.

Members of the Expert Committees had less than 70 days to partition the British Indian state. Within this ridiculously short span, all departmental assets and financial liabilities were to be divided. Moreover, departmental files and records were to be separated, keeping in mind the possible future requirements of both countries, and government employees were to be divided as well. Added to this, the committee members had to ensure that the necessary infrastructure was instituted in both Karachi and Delhi, as well as in the provincial capitals, to run the governments. Delhi was already the capital of undivided India and a system was in place. Similarly, Calcutta too had the necessary set-up. However, the scene was very different in Karachi or in Dhaka. Karachi had so far been the provincial capital of Sindh. But the city was not equipped to become the capital of an entire country all of a sudden.

For example, the External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations Department in undivided India had 203 typewriters. It was estimated that after partition, the workload of the Delhi office would reduce and 182 typewriters would be sufficient in the new situation.19 The rest could be sent to Pakistan. Similar lists were also prepared by the representatives of the Pakistan side. For the office of the Ministry of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, it was estimated that 31 pen stands, 125 paper cabinets, 16 easy chairs, 31 officers’ tables, 20 peon benches, among many other things, were needed.20 Officers involved in partitioning India thus had to take stock of everything: from a ceiling fan to a board pin, and then determine what should go to which side.

problems were manifold. In Bengal, for instance, Hindus had a pre-dominant
presence in government jobs and they mostly opted to serve the new West Bengal
government. Consequently, the Government of West Bengal suddenly had a large
surplus of staff members who had previously been posted in different areas of the
eastern part of the undivided province and who had now opted for service under
the West Bengal government.
