[[Year-2023]]


things i am proud of accomplishing this year
- graduated college
- bagged an off campus role at a fintech startup which i didnt apply for
- bought myself a really beautiful bike with my own money
- invested for the first time and in the process of my work learnt a heck lot about venture capital and finance without actually realising it
- bought my father a mobile phone and my mother a saree with my salary 
- took working out more seriously and started looking not as skinny as earlier
- spent alot of good quality time with my girlfriend
- learnt alot about life out in the real world, learnt how i actually dont know half the things i thought i knew and neither did i liked the things i thought i liked.
- played football on most weekends

also, some things im not proud of:
- not talking enough about my problems to people
- not grieving enough and bursting out of my emotions all at once
- being too recluse and stayed distant from my friends (sometimes)
- been terminally online on twitter
- read less consistently compared to what i used to normally read
- had a horrific sleep schedule

this year has been a emotional roller coaster tbh but fuck it we ball onto the next one
