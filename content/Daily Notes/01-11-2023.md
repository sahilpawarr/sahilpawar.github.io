## under communism, how does the concept of cities exist if a city means a area more developed than others

Under communism, the concept of cities would exist, but the idea of a city being more developed than other areas would be minimized. The goal is to create equitable urban development and resource distribution to reduce disparities between regions.

In communism, cities would exist but with a focus on equitable resource distribution. Disparities between cities can result from historical and geographic factors and would be addressed through planned development and resource allocation to achieve more equitable growth.
