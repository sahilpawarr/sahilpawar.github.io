1. [[Poor Economics by Banerjee and Duflo]] 
	1. Foreword 
		- Average poverty line in the 50 countries where most poor people live is 16 Indian rupees per person per day. This corresponds to 36 US cent (99 cents adjusted to PPP). So to imagine lives of poor, think having to live in Miami with 99 cents per day for almost all your everyday needs other than housing. 865 million people live this way
		- The poor can be considered more rational than anyone else. Because they have so little, they put more thought into their choices. They have to be sophisticated economists just to survive.
