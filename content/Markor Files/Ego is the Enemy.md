The pioneering CEO Robert Green compares Egoism to Alcoholism
"The egoist does not stumble about, knocking things off his desk. He does not stammer or drool. No ,instead he becomes more and more arrogant and some people, not knowing what is underneath this attitude, mistake this arrogance for a sense of Power and Self-confidence" You can say that they start to mistake that about themselves too, not realising the disease they've contractedi or that they're killing themselves with it 

If Ego is the voice that tells us we're better than we really are, we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.

One of the early members of Alcoholics Anonymous defined ego as " a conscious seperation ***from***"
From what? 
**Everything**

Just one thing keeps ego around - comfort
Pursuing great work - weather in sports or art or business- is often terrifying. Ego, soothes this fear. It's a salve to this insecurity. Replacing the rational and are parts of our psyche with self-absorption, who tells us what we want to hear, when we want to hear it

It's a short term fix with a long term consequence
When you remove ego, we're left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility yes, but rock hard humility and confidence.
Whereas exp is artificial, this tour of confidence can hold weight.
Ego is stolen, confidence is earned

## William Tecumseh Sherman
"Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognisable- those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and it's fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the Sham of insincere self-deprecation but the modesty of "moderation", in the Greek sense

It is poise, not pose
 
## John Boyd
 **_to do or to be?_** which way will you go?
 
 
Whatever we seek to do in life, reality soon intrudes in our youthful idealism. This reality comes in many names and forms: incentives, commitments, recognition and Politics.


In every case they can be quickly redirect us from _doing_ to _being_. From _earning_ to _pretending_
Thats what Boyd wanted young people to see that if we aren't careful, we can easily find ourselves corrupted by the very occupation we wish to serve.

How to prevent derailment? Well we often fall in love with an _image_ of what success looks like. In Boyd's world the number of stars on the shoulder could be confused as proxy for success. For others it cohlf be their job title, the business school they attended, size of the paycheck etc

Appearance is deceiving. _having_ authority is not the same as _being_ an authority. _having_ the right and _being_ right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn't necessarily mean you are doing good work and that doesn't make you worthy of promotion.

_**impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive**_


## Restrain yourself
Our own path whatever we aspire to, will in some way be defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with. Our humiliations will pale in comparison to Robinson's but it will still be hard.

Relax.

Your ego all do you no favours, whether you are struggling with a publisher, with critics, with enemies or a capricious boss. It doesn't matter that they don't understand it that you know better. It's da m to early for that. It's too soon. 

Havo a degree or credentials doesn't stop people from treating you like shit.

It doesn't matter how talented you are, how big your connections, are how much money you have, when you want to do something- something big and important and meaningful - you will be subject to treatment that is ranging from indifference to outright sabotage.

Count on it.

## Danger of early pride
- Pride blunts the very intrument we need to own in order to succeed: Our mind
- pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one
- Christians believe that pride is a sin because it's a lie -- it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and. Connection with their fellow man. You don't have to be a Christian to see the wisdom in this.
