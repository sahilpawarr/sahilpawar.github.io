What is a product or service which was kore efficient 10 years ago than itnis today 
Almost nothing

Hurdles create wealth. If I tell you tomorrow a pill I made will cure your eyesight I'll be a billionaire.


Efficiency scoring method.
If taxi is 3 a ola cap Experience is an 8.
As long as the ∆ is >=4 you are creating wealth.
Just because ola maps doesn't work doesn't mean you are going back. ∆=>4 means no going back.

How many downloaded truecaller by an ad? Nobody. When humans discover ∆4 they tell everyone about it because they gain social currency by saying that.!

Branded lens: if a product is designed and becomes ∆4, it takes the form of a verb 
Send me a whatsapp, Google it, book an uber, Xerox it


1) infleceners
2) fake inefficiency


Earlier influence was limited to everything that had distribution. Distribution was limited to radio, tv, cinema. These were the influencers. Untill reality shows came in and normal people got a chance of the limelight. Now with tiktok and instagram any person can be an influencer. All of them now are media channels and have influence. They probably don't influence in the same manner. A teenage boy from a tier 3 city who is good at dancing probably can't convince you to buy a car, but can convince you to by an FMCG product

Fake inefficiency. Best example for this is dandruff companies. 100 years ago no one cared about dandruff. It was dead skin on your head that's it. Now if you have dandruff, just because of media, it's unattractive. Women were told that you should not like somebody that was dandruff. Other examples, brushing teeth etc.

A popular meme is on everyone's phone within 3-4 hours. In a world where everything moves sooo fast, if your product isn't worth spreading, the youth is not interested in you. Let's go back to biology to understand this. Common cold and HIV both are viruses. But it's easier to catch a common cold than an HIV virus. I'm no biology student, but one reason for this could be because the Hiv virus is probably 1000x more heavier than common cold. If your product isn't a common cold it won't be marketed through air. 

Younger generation is kore bored than you. Because they have identified patterns and find everything predictable. "I know you will say this". When a child watches a cartoon 5 toems that's because they haven't figured out the pattern and everytime they see it they are watching something new. That's why game of thrones is so popular in youth but something like CID isnt. That's the whole point of tiktok that you can't expect what's coming next
