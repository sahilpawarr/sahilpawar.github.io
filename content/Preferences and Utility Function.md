Preferential assumptions:
- completeness
- transitivity
- non satiation - more is better


Four properties for the indifference curve
- consumers prefer higher indifference curves. - (thus as indifference curve shifts out people are happier)
- indifference curves are downward sloping (non satiable)
- indifference curves never cross(goes against transitivity)


Diminishing marginal utility will fall the more you consume a good. You'll have lesser happiness from the "next" unit
