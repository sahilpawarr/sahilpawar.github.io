- Definition:
	- A product who's value is derived from another underlying variable asset
- Explanation:
	- Imagine a wheat farmer is concerned about the price of wheat dropping before the harvest season. The farmer expects to harvest 1,000 kilograms of wheat in three months and wants to protect against a potential price decrease.
	
	- The farmer decides to use a futures contract, a type of derivative, to hedge against the risk of falling wheat prices. The farmer enters into a futures contract to sell 1,000 kilograms of wheat at $5 per kilogram in three months. This means the farmer locks in a selling price now, regardless of the market price at harvest time.
	
	- If the market price of wheat falls below $5 per kilogram by the contract's expiration, the farmer benefits because they can sell at the higher, agreed-upon price. However, if the market price rises above $5, the farmer is still obligated to sell at the lower price but may miss out on potential profit in the open market.
