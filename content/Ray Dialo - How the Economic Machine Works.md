[[Short Term Debt Cycle]] [[Productivity Growth]] [[Long Term Debt Cycle]]


## Short Term Debt Cycle
- As economic activty inceases we see an **expansion** -- the first phase of the short term debt cycle
- Spending continiues to increase and prices start to rise
- This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit
- When the amount of spending and income grows faster than the production of goods, prices rise
- When prises rise, we call this inflation
- Now, the [[central bank]] doesnt want too much inflation, because it causes problems
- Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates
- With higher interest rates, fewer people can borrow money, and the cost of existing debt rises
- Now, because people borrow lesser and have to pay back higher debt repayments, they have less money left over to spend, their spending reduces
- And as one person's spending is another person's income, income's drop
 - When people spend less, prices go down --  we call this deflation
 - This reduces economic activity and we have a recession
 - If the recession becomes too severe, and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank lowers interest rates to cause everything to pick up agian
- With lower interest rates, debt repayments are reduced, thus increasing borrowings, thus increasing spendings and thus increasing incomes, resulting in another expansion
- ### When credit is easily available, there is an economic expansion
