    [[Short Term Debt Cycle]] [[Productivity Growth]] [[Long Term Debt Cycle]]


## Short Term Debt Cycle
- As economic activty inceases we see an **expansion** -- the first phase of the short term debt cycle
- Spending continiues to increase and prices start to rise
- This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit
- When the amount of spending and income grows faster than the production of goods, prices rise
- When prises rise, we call this inflation
- Now, the [[central bank]] doesnt want too much inflation, because it causes problems
- Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates
- With higher interest rates, fewer people can borrow money, and the cost of existing debt rises
- Now, because people borrow lesser and have to pay back higher debt repayments, they have less money left over to spend, their spending reduces
- And as one person's spending is another person's income, income's drop
 - When people spend less, prices go down --  we call this deflation
 - This reduces economic activity and we have a recession
 - If the recession becomes too severe, and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank lowers interest rates to cause everything to pick up again
- With lower interest rates, debt repayments are reduced, thus increasing borrowings, thus increasing spendings and thus increasing incomes, resulting in another expansion
- #### In a short term debt cycle, spending is constrained by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit 
- #### When credit is easily available, there is an economic expansion, when credit is not easily available -- there is a recession

Even though debt is growing, income is growing as well to offset the debt
As long as the income continues to rise, the debt burden (debt to income ratio) stays managable
But, over decades - debt burden slowly increases creating large and larger debt repayments 
At some point, debt repayments starts growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending
Since one persons spending is another persons income, incomes begin to fall 
Which makes people less credit worthy, causing borrowing to go down
And thus, the cycle reverses itself -- amoungst other things, asset prices drop, stock market crashes, banks are squeezed out, and social tension rises. This is called a deleveraging

As incomes fall and debt repayments rise, borrowers get squeezed
They cant borrow money to make their debt repayments because their credit worthiness has dried up
To make up for this gap, borrowers are forced to sell assets 

1. Although a deleveraging is similar to a recession, a deleveraging cannot be solved by simply lowering interest rates
2. In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate borrowing. In a deleveraging, lower interest rates dont work because interest rates are already low and soon hits zero. 
3. Another difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging the debt burden has simply gotten too big and cant be relieved by lowering interest rates.
4. Interest rates in the UNited states touched 0% in the 1930s and again in 2008. 
 
### So how is a deleveraging solved?
Four ways this can happen:
1. People, businesses and governments cut down spending (austerity)
	1. When borrowers stop taking on new debt and start paying older debts, the assumption is that the debt burden will decrease, but the opposite happens. This is because spending is cut off because of debt repayments, which reduces income. The income ends up falling faster than the repayments of debt, causing the debt burden to get worse.
	2. In the hope to reduce spending, businesses are forced to cut costs, which leads to lesser jobs and unemployment
2. Debts are reduced by defaults and restructuring 
	1. Most borrowers arent able to repay their debt during a deleveraging, and a borrowers debt is a lenders asset.
	2. When borrowers are unable to pay back debt, the lenders -- in the hope to protect their money withdraw from the banks -- leading to bank defaults
3. Redistribution of wealth
	1. 
4. Central Bank prints more money
