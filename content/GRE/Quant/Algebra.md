## Quadratic Equations


## System - Number of Solutions
- a system of two equations with two unknowns may have one solution, no solution or infinitely many solutions 
- if u solve and get an ALWAYS TRUE (12=12) equation, then infintely many solutions
- If u solve and get NEVER TRUE (-2=9) then the system has no solutions
