# More on Mean and Median
- If all the numbers on the list are evenly spaced, or if the list is symmetrically distributed, then mean = median
- Outliers pull the mean away from the median 
- We often can compare mean and median -- or infer which one is smaller or bigger without calculation, purely by observing the direction of outliers 

# Weighted Averages I
- Best way to approach weighted averages is to think in terms of sums. When you have the average and number/percentage of units available
- Also,
	- average of whole = A1p1 + A2p2 + A3p3
