# More on Mean and Median
- If all the numbers on the list are evenly spaced, or if the list is symmetrically distributed, then mean = median
- Outliers pull the mean away from the median 
- We often can compare mean and median -- or infer which one is smaller or bigger without calculation, purely by observing the direction of outliers 

# Weighted Averages I
- Best way to approach weighted averages is to think in terms of sums. When you have the average and number/percentage of units available
- Also,
	- average of whole = A1p1 + A2p2 + A3p3


# Range and Standard Deviation

- #### Range
	- range = max val - min val
- #### Standard Deviation
	- it is a way to measure how far away from the mean are the individual points
	- some facts of SD
		- SD can only be positive or zero, never negative
		- if all numbers in the set are the same, then the SD is zero
		- a set with most numbers clustered to the extremes will have a higher standard deviation than a list who's values are closer to mean
		- if we add/substract the same number to every number on the set, the SD does not change
