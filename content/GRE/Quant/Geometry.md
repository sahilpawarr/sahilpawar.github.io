# Similar Triangles
-If a segment across a triangle is parallel to one os the sides, it automatically creates a smaller similar triangle
- sides of similar figures are proportional
- angles of similar figures are equal
- Scale Factor (k): read more on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Special Right Triangles
- #1 Isoc Right Triangle, for this hypotenuse = root 2 * (leg)
- #2 30-6-90, for this 
	hypotenuse = 2 * (short leg)
	long leg = root 3 * (short leg)

# Quadrilateral
Parallelogram: 4 properties (lets call this big 4)
- opposite sides are parallel 
- opposite sides are equal
- opposite angles are equal
- diagonal bisects each other

Rhombus:
- big 4 properties
- four sides are equal
- diagonals are perpendicular bisectors

Rectangles:
- big 4 properties
- all four angles are 90 degrees
- diagonals are equal

Squares:
- all rectangle, rhombus and parallelogram properties

Trapezoid
- one pair of parallel sides
- parallel sides are called bases, non parallel are called legs

Isosceles Trapezoid/ symmetrical trapezoid
- if bases are parallel and legs are congruent, then angles on each base are congruent and diagonals are also congruent

NOTE: if you are asked to find the length of a diagonal or a slanted line, chances are good there is a pythogrean theorem hidden 



# Area of Quadrilaterals

- Square: s²
- For other special quadrilaterals: bxh (remember that height has to be perpendicular to base always)
- For trapezoids, thing are slightly different because there are two bases and two parellels sides

# Polygons
- Diagonals in a polygon
	- Triangle - no diagonals
	- Quadrilateral - two diagonals
	- Pentagon - 5 diagonals
	- Hexagon - 9 diagonals
	- Octagon - 20 diagonals
- Angles in a polygon
	- Triangle - 180
	- Quadrilateral - 360 (2 triangles)
	- Pentagon - 540 (3 triangles)
	- Hexagon - 720 (4 triangles)
	- Octagon - 1080 (6 triangles)

# Regular Polygons
- REWATCH THE VIDEO FOR THIS AND MAKE NOTES

# Circles
- all radii have same length
- c=πd or c=2πr
- A = πr²
- Strategy for circle problems: find radius first, then everything else

# Circle Properties
- if two sides of a triangle are radii, the triangle is isosceles
-  A central angle has the same measure as the arc it intercepts
	- ![[Pasted image 20240703132812.png]]
- Equal chord lengths intercept equal arcs
	- ![[Pasted image 20240703132843.png]]
- Inscribed angle has half the measure of the arc it intercepts
	- ![[Pasted image 20240703133006.png]]
- Angle inscribed in a semicircle is 90 degrees
- Two inscribed angles interecting the same chord on the same side are equal
- Tangent is perpendicular to radius
