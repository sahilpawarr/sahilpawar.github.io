## strong link weak link

Football is a weak link sport. You are only as good as your weakest player. No player can go from one end of the pitch to the other on his own he needs players around him to actually progress a football. Every goal is a series of 5-8 good passes on average. Even if one pass goes wrong the process has to be repeated all over again.

Basketball however, is a strong link sport. Here the better your best player the better your team plays. A LeBron games can take the ball from one end to the other on his own with ease. A basketball team doesn't need 5 prolific players in the team it needs one, or probably 2 world class players to win the championship. Even the best basketball teams of all time, Bulls of the 90s and Warriors of this generation have only 2 players who are actually the "world class" type. The remaining 3 players are better than average at best who wouldn't even make the first team in any other club. Very easily replaceable. 

For example if you are starting a hedge fund or investment group. You are building this on the strong link paradigm. If you have a Warren Buffett it doesn't really matter who your 15th analyst is. Why does Google pay so much money to its best programmer? Because one good programmer is better than 50 mediocre ones and he's the one making the difference.

But now let's say for example, you are given a 100million and told to improve the Indian education landscape in the next 5 years. In this case, you don't start by improving the IITs and the NITs and other top level colleges. But instead you should be improving the relatively weaker 2nd and 3rd tier colleges and trying to bring them to the level of the dream colleges.
