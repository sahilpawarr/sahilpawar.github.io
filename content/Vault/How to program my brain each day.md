<h2>How to program my brain each day</h2>


**Why is everyone surprised when I mention that I do a visualization practice each morning as part of my startup routine?**

+ It seems obvious to me. High performance athletes have done this for decades — closing their eyes and envisioning themselves executing their craft at the optimal level. Not just watching it in their mind, but feeling it. Experiencing it.
+ Our minds can transport us. We’ve all had dreams and reflections that felt so real, where we believed we were somewhere else, doing something else.
Sometimes it happens without intention, but it can also be done by design. This is one of the ways in which we can program our minds in the directions we want to evolve.



**My visualization practice is applied in one of two ways**. 

When a challenging or stressful activity is coming up, close your eyes and walk yourself through it ahead of time in your mind.

1. Watch yourself in your mind’s eye walking through the key stages — the moments beforehand preparing, focusing, stepping onto the stage, starting, and then flowing through it. Really feel it viscerally, feel the temperature of the room and the sensation of the environment and the sounds you anticipate. Transport yourself to the place, and go through the event watching and feeling yourself performing perfectly. The more tactile it feels, the more it will stick. This is great training for any challenging activity
2. But many days we don’t have a single challenging event approaching, just the ordinary day-in and day-out grind. Yet these days too have challenges that we struggle to overcome. Distractions tug at us from every turn, and we feel resistance to starting pressing priorities. 
3. If you write out the next day’s schedule the evening before (as I highly recommend), then this is not hard since your plan is already defined

What you’re doing is creating a default path, an instinctive way in, a mental muscle memory that will remove some of the resistance that has historically led you astray. When done well, it will better guide you on the optimal planned path.
