Hey (name),
Thanks for the note. I am so proud of you for --- and I'm flattered that you'd like to bring my brain into the mix.

I need to say "no" because ---

But I would like to support you in a different way. *offer an alternative form of support*

Thank you for being such a wonderful ---. I am honored to be a part of your world

*A few lines of encouragement if you want to*

YOUR NAME

**You gain the 'right' of saying no only by saying yes many times before**
