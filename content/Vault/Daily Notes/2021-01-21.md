AK connected me with [[Vardhan Koshal]] who is the co-founder of [[Tortiose]] About to send him a mail in a few hours today itself



Watched a few videos on how to [[cold mail]] and on [[Network]]



**Connection request for [[Vardhan Koshal]] to AK**

Over the last few days I've been gaining interest in product management. Not very serious (yet) but I just want to explore the field more and gaining some understanding on it.
There's a guy, [[Vardhan Koshal]] who is the founder of a Fintech company called [[Tortoise]]. I've been monitoring his work on various platforms for over a month and they are still in the 'pre-product' stage and Vardhan's work is really inspiring. I wanted to get in touch with him and turns out he's a GIPE alumni! He also put out a LinkedIn post 2 days ago saying something like 'its easy to hire with referrals and friends'.Â 
I am not asking you to refer me or something I want to try to do this on my own, but can you help me in how I should approach it?
I am already doing a Digital Marketing internship for a healthtech starup right now, which I got by cold mailing the CEO in the exact same way, and it should end around end of February. For now, my main goal is to build a connection and to [[Network]]with Vardhan. Would love to hear your thoughts on this :)
