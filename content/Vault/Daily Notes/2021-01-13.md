[[Zettelkasten]]
Nikalas Luhmann wrote about 70 books and 500 articles in his lifetime. He used a system of note taking which involved joining thoughts and ideas together such that they resembled threads like ones in Twitter. 
SImilar to a brain which jumps from one thought to the other and travels through thoughts by a link, [[Zettelkasten]] is a method which connects your thoughts and ideas which one captures thorughout a lifetime and connects them into almost like a second brain which acts like a storage center of ideas and inspiration.

**The point of note-taking is to think better**. Capturing is a means to it; retention is merely a side effect.

[[Specialization over Generalization]] is considered superior in todays world because niching down helps explore the fields in depth.
But niching down often results in missing out on other fields which are closely related to the similar field.
For Example a student studying only Economics and Maths for research purposes misses out on subjects like Sociology, Psychology etc which provide thoughts and ideas which are conntected for a better understanding of Economics itself.
