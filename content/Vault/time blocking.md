[[Tim Ferriss]] [[Jerry Seinfeld]] [[Creativity]] [[Writing]]
Jerry Seinfeld : best way to get efficient at writing is to block out time especially for creative work. You don't need to write in this time if you can't. The rule is that you can't do ANYTHING else in this time.

-Wake Up Atleast one hour before you look at a screen
-Make a cup of tea and sit down with a pen and paper
-Write down 3 to 5 things not more of things that make you anxious and uncomfortable.
-blovk out time atleast 2 to 3 hours to get the most imp of these done, the rest can wait
-this period is a block not 10 minutes here and 10 mintues there
