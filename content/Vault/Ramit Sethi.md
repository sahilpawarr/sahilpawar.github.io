[[I will Teach you to be rich]]   [[Personal Finance]]  [[Tim Ferris Show]]

In life you don't get what you deserve you get what you negotiate

<h2>Tim Ferriss Show Notes </h2>
     Talks about how he used to be irrational with his decisions even when he knew what he was doing. Like hiring a fitness instructor even when he could get all the knowledge for free on YouTube and books. It was the last additional percentage advantage that made him hire one. 

   Similarly he recalls how he'd be judgemental of how people spend their money. Laugh on how people spend 80% more on Business Class Tickets when even an Economy class took them to the same place in the same time, says financial literacy helped him change his judgement and ask the question "what makes them do that?"
