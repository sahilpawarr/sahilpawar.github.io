What makes a good blogpost?
Proof of work
Very difficult to master yet extremely easy to verifiy
If someone sees that there is a good amount of work put in they consider that as good work

Similarly with graphic design difficult to master bit if someone understands basics of photoshop they'll think that the worm you've done is not **that** difficult to do

Invariably the younger you are the less earned wisdom you have. If I'm a 14 year old talking about how to build a business no one might listen to me. But if Elon talks about how he build Tesla there's a huge audience already

Introvert is an identity category. Introverts see being introvert as an important part of their character,who they are the bongld they should have with other introverts and something to be seen about them etc. This seems to me far less true for extroverts. I have NEVER seen anyone self identifying as an extrovert.

There's a phonemeon that you can get an idea of what invisible forces people are feeling in their lives by the things they feel the need to signal.
