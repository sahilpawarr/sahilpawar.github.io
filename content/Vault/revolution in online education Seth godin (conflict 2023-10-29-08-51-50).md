[[Seth Godin]] [[Education]] [[Blogpost Ideas]]

## CP notes from from [this blog](https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-revolution-in-online-learning/)
Not education, learning.

Education is a model based on scarcity, compliance and accreditation. It trades time, attention and money for a piece of paper that promises value.

But we learn in ways that have little to do with how mass education is structured.

If you know how to walk, write, read, type, have a conversation, perform surgery or cook an egg, it’s probably because you practiced and explored and experienced, not because it was on a test.

We’re in danger of repeating the failed approaches of education in an online setting.
