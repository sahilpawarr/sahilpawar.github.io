how cool would it be if student councils in schools would be more than just a head boy/girl, house captians and a bunch of prefects. Imagine a 'finance minister' who along with his fellow 'ministers' form a pseudo economy for the school. You earn psuedo-money for doing simple tasks in school like cleaning the school ground, maintaining proper queues and having a decent haircut.. More extra curricular clubs can be formed, organizing art events debates etc and winners can be gifted with this pseudo-currency. This pseudo-money can then be used in school canteens , as fees for joining extra curricular clubs, and many more things This way instead of punishing or fining students for not following rules you are incentivising them to not only be better disciplined but also show more participation in school events and extra curricular activities. Not to forget the fact that these students learn trade, how to manage personal finance and concepts like demand and supply from a very young age. This idea is pretty raw and isn't perfect by any means but can be fine tuned and improved to move formal education from being limited to books to the amazing outside world .
