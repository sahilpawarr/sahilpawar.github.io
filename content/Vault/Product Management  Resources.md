[[Product Management]]
# What resources do you recommend for people who want to learn more about product management? 

Lots of people blog about product management.  I really recommend Julie Zhuo, who writes [The Year of the Looking Glass](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass) on Medium; some posts are all about product managers. Intercom also has a really great [product blog](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-and-design/). I also find it helpful to look at general purpose management books, like [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=asc_df_0679762884/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312065696873&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7464546985126879786&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019659&hvtargid=pla-487139763997&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61316180399&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312065696873&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7464546985126879786&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019659&hvtargid=pla-487139763997) or [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) that aren't specifically about product management. but a lot of general management's principles are ones that product managers will find helpful.

On our YouTube channel, [The Product Way](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWX_c4YmANF1jPggAjO5Mnw), we have hundreds of videos from mentors and product management masters. They’re giving advice, walking people through lessons. Some of my favorites are [Alisa Warshawski’s tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqV0bS3oAMs) on getting into product management, and [Brian Croft's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivFOTfLxxS0) on figuring out if you’re cut out for the role.
