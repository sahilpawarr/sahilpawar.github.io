[[Creativity]] [[Books]] [[Book Notes]]



- > The only art I’ll ever study is stuff that I can steal from.” - David Bowie



- Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.”



- > What is originality? Undetected plagiarism — William Ralph Inge

- Marcel Duchamp said, “I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.” This is actually a pretty good method for studying—if you try to devour the history of your discipline all at once, you’ll choke.

- Filmmaker John Waters has said, “Nothing is more important than an unread library.”

- I once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!”


- > The artist Stanley Donwood, who’s made all the album artwork for the band Radiohead, says computers are alienating because they put a sheet of glass between you and whatever is happening

- once the computer is involved, “things are on an inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless.”

- That’s how I try to do all my work now. I have two desks in my office—one is “analog” and one is “digital.” The analog desk has nothing but markers, pens, pencils, paper, index cards, and newspaper. Nothing electronic is allowed on that desk. This is where most of my work is born, and all over the desk are physical traces, scraps, and residue from my process. (Unlike a hard drive, paper doesn’t crash.) The digital desk has my laptop, my monitor, my scanner, and my drawing tablet. This is where I edit and publish my work.

- The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.”

- I get some of my best ideas when I’m bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts—it’s so boring, I almost always get good ideas. If you’re out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can.

 
- > You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards


- It’s so important to have a hobby. A hobby is something creative that’s just for you. You don’t try to make money or get famous off it, you just do it because it makes you happy. A hobby is something that gives but doesn’t take. While my art is for the world to see, music is only for me and my friends. We get together every Sunday and make noise for a couple of hours. No pressure, no plans. It’s regenerative. It’s like church.


- > Modern art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn’t.” —Craig Damrauer

 
- Neil Young sang, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.” I say it’s better to burn slow and see your grandkids

- Inertia is the death of creativity.


- What you’ll probably find is that the corollary to Parkinson’s Law is usually true: Work gets done in the time available.


- In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what’s really important to them.
