Goals vs Systems
- goal is an end product, system is a way of tracking progress
- if you are a writer writing a book is your goal, but your creative process, the way you research, your daily writing habit all these are systems
- cleaning a messy room is a goal. But inculcating habits to keep the room un-messy is a system. If these aren't followed a week later this room is going to be messy again

Overdefining goals gives you a sense of weird satisfaction. 
Telling someone about what you plan to do "5 years later" gives this very addictive dopamine hit which gives you a feeling that you have already achieved what you say you **want** to achieve. 
Just like masturbation, overthinking of your goals gives a sense of achieving something when in reality you haven't achieved anything.
The illusion of achieving progress is actually worse than not thinking about progress at all.

- Love the process over the result. Writing a best seller is the easy part. Writing everyday is what you need to do.
