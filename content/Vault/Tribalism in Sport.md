## Tribalism is not fandom: Time for football clubs to act (football365)
- I am a Middlesbrough supporter and will be until my last breath and I love that thought. It is a constant in the shifting sands of my life and it has provided, shaped and expressed a strand of my identity.


-   This isn’t unusual. We all have our tribes – the people who we feel most comfortable around, the people we have something in common with and who share our passions.

-  They would say all of this just makes them a loyal and true supporter, I suspect. Someone who bases a lot of their lives around the club and the club’s history, to such a degree that a comment about the club is a comment about themselves as a person. Insult the club and you insult them.


- I’ve written before about Old Firm fans who would count words in a newspaper dedicated to their club and then count the number written on the other mob and actually ring up the paper to complain if their club didn’t get as many, complaining of bias. That’s how extreme it can get.

- But the tribal monster is apparently blind and sees their perception as absolute.

- So in this way, we can see the tribal football fan is a threat, not just to individuals, but to free speech itself. And yet we’re all very inured to it. It’s all become totally normalised and so we tend to shrug it off as just ‘those’ people, when really, we should be shocked or offended by it.

- If you don’t believe me, expose a non-football following friend in your life to some examples of typical football tribalism and see how they react. The horror on their faces will tell you everything. Outside of the football context, this is extreme behaviour and it needs identifying as such. As much as anyone else, clubs need to point out that this is no longer acceptable and is not a prerequisite to call yourself a fan of the club.

why do sports fan have such a passion and desire for their teams
why take extreme measures like face painting, wearing the same clothes every single game or travelling hundreds if not thousands of miles to watch their team play

Saying things like we won or you guys lost, in short including themselves in the teams action. 

Thomas Vinci a sports psychologist characterises this with two sinple acronuyms
when your fav team wins you BIRG: Bask in Reflected Glory
when they lose you CORF: Cut of reflected failure

but these arent the only two bases on which you can categorise a fan

many teams will go years and even decades withour winning titles and still have large fan bases
This is because sports fans commonly beleive that to acheive true fandom they must remain loyal to their teams under any circumstances even if that means losing ten years or going 65 years without winning the league (sorry totenham fans)

from mass riots to non stop chanting this phenonomenon of de individualisation meaning c=that the actions go unknown desipite the consequences
this is because larger the group the less each fan feels   accountable for individual responsibility
combine 10s nd thousands of such fans and s sporting event can quickly escalate into a dangerous situation	

### parasocial relationships
fans who love celebrities but obvious;y 


natural inclination to be in f=groups biologically crafted that way. pre historically this worked
