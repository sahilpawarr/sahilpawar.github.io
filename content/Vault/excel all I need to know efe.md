### 

- Is it possible to work with text data in Excel? Can you give me an example?
- What exactly is conditional formatting? Can you tell me about a time you used it in MS-Excel?
- How would you password protect a file in Excel?
- When are you better off using data filters instead of pivot tables? Whatever your answer, what is your reasoning?
- I’m not a fan of pie charts. Do you agree with my opinion, or not? Why?
- Give me your best guess about a keyboard shortcut in Excel that I’ll not be aware of.
- Index and Match, or Vlookup – which is better, and why?
- How would you go about creating dynamic charts in Excel? Or sentences that update automatically when new data is fed in to the sheet?
- What is your favorite Excel add-in? Why?
- Walk me through the coolest project you’ve ever done in Excel. (This last one if I’m convinced that you are a proper, legit Excel ninja)
