Perfectionism is a common personality trait of high achievers. Da Vinci, Beethoven, Copernicus, and Newton were all notorious perfectionists. More recent examples include Stanley Kubrick, Martha Stewart, Steve Jobs, Serena Williams, and Kanye West.

Under the guise of an obsessive commitment to excellence, perfectionism is worn as a badge of honor among world-class athletes and performers who frequently attribute their successes to a self-ascribed unwillingness to accept mediocrity.

But perfectionism is not without its pitfalls. The pursuit of excellence is a slippery slope that can easily mutate into a compulsive striving for unrealistic goals that leads to a vicious cycle of frustration, anxiety, and even _diminished_ performance.
