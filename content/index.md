Hey there! I am sahil, and this is my little hypertext [[Networked Thought|garden]] on the internet. 

Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of data and finance at [Cambridge Wealth](https://www.cambridgewealth.in/) . My interests include largely everything related to [[Economics|economics]] - but more specifically I care deeply for areas revolving around macroeconomic policy, fintech, microfinance based [[financial inclusion]] and decarbonization. 

I am passively [[curious]] about practically everything that I wish to find answers to. I’ve always said my perfect career would be whatever pays me to just learn everything all the time for no specific reason. like a scholar for hire.

Here you'll find all my [[bad ideas]] and me trying to make fruitful sense of these ideas by finding connections in them. Think of it as an extension of my thoughts - almost like a second brain! 

For more long form polished work, you can check out my [substack](https://sahilpawar.substack.com/) here. 

Apart from all this, you'll find me playing or watching football, reading books, listening to podcasts or trying to improve my German. I also have begun running regularly and am currently trying to break the mental block of 5 kms in 20 minutes.
