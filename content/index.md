Hey there! I am Sahil Pawar, and this is my little hypertext digital garden on the internet. 

I recently graduated from GIPE with a degree in economics, and currently I’m working as an Analyst | Founder's Office at [**Cambridge Wealth**](http://www.cambridgewealth.in/), an early stage fintech startup, where I work at the intersection of data, business and finance. 

I am a generalist at heart and possess an inherent curiosity to dive into practically everything around me that I wish to find answers to. I’ve always said my perfect career would be whatever pays me to just learn everything all the time for no specific reason. like a scholar for hire.

I am curious, have alot of [[bad ideas]] and love connecting these bad ideas together (as you can tell from this page). This curiosity helps me whereby I can juggle some bits and hopefully make your life more enjoyable.

I read alot of [[Books|books]], listen to [[Podcast Notes |podcasts]] and recently have gotten interested in [[Urdu Qawaali]]. Other than all this you'll find me either playing football, watching a late night Arsenal football match, or trying to improve my German. I also have begun running regularly and am currently trying to break the mental block of 5 kms in 20 minutes.

While at university,  I interned for the **[Standord Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)** for the **[FUSE](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/fuse.stanford.edu)** project where I did field research and data analysis on the FWE consumption during Covid-19 and was a project intern at the **[Policy Research Organisation](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/policyresearch.in)** where I worked with historical data of Pune Municipal Corporation’s annual budgets, to offer informed policy recommendations to local policymakers. Additionally, I interned at **[Evolve](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/evolveinc.io)** for their Growth and Analytics team and as a UX researcher at **[Moonraft Innovation Labs](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/moonraft.com)** where I worked on the strategy to execute a virtual reality metaverse project for a global tech event.

If you wish to collaborate or discuss ideas, please email me at [1sahilpawar@gmail.com](mailto:1sahilpawar@gmail.com). I’m always up for a chat.
