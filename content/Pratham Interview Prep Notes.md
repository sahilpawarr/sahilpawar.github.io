# Question 1: 

Slide 1: Dot-and-Whisker Plot of Progress in Mathematical and language abilities
1. The plot illustrates the mean differences between each endline and baseline assessments.
2. Each dot on the plot represents the mean difference, while the whisker around it indicates the confidence intervals, signifying the variability or uncertainty associated with the mean difference.
3. Positive mean differences signify an improvement in mathematical abilities from baseline to each subsequent endline assessment, suggesting a positive impact of the program intervention on students' mathematical skills.
4. Overall, the results are statistically significant as the confidence intervals for the mean differences do not include zero.
5. This indicates a significant change from baseline to each endline assessment, suggesting that the program intervention has a consistent and positive impact on students' numeracy and language skills over time.

# Question 2
In our analysis for Question 2, we aimed to identify which states could provide recommendations to others based on their performance in math and language assessments. To achieve this, we conducted regression analyses and examined the coefficients of each state relative to the reference state, Chattisgarh.

First, let's delve into the findings for mathematical abilities. We ran regression models for each endline assessment, and here are the key coefficients we obtained:

- For Gujarat, the coefficient is -0.4922521, indicating a lower math score compared to Chattisgarh.
- Karnataka also exhibits a lower math score, with a coefficient of -0.5067210.
- Maharashtra follows a similar trend, with a coefficient of -0.4819936.

These negative coefficients suggest that Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have lower math scores compared to Chattisgarh. Therefore, Chattisgarh could potentially offer valuable insights or recommendations to these states based on its relatively better performance in math scores.

Now, let's turn our attention to language abilities. Here are the coefficients we obtained:

- For Gujarat, the coefficient is -0.5155975, indicating a lower language score compared to Chattisgarh.
- Karnataka also exhibits a lower language score, with a coefficient of -0.9272358.
- Maharashtra follows suit, with a coefficient of -0.5403917.

Similarly to the math scores, these negative coefficients suggest that Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have lower language scores compared to Chattisgarh. Consequently, Chattisgarh could potentially provide recommendations or insights to these states based on its relatively better performance in language scores.

In conclusion, our analysis highlights the potential for Chattisgarh to share valuable insights and recommendations with Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, both in terms of math and language abilities. These findings underscore the importance of collaborative learning and sharing best practices among states to enhance educational outcomes.

# Question 3
- Introduction:
    - We explored cross-competency trends, focusing on the relationship between learning progress in language and math.
- Analysis Process:
    - Initially, we plotted the progress of reading and math scores from baseline to Endline 4 using mean differences.
    - Examined the relationship between mean language and math scores across all assessments.
- Findings:
    - Positive Trends in Proficiency:
        - Observed significant improvement in mean differences of both language and math scores from baseline to Endline 4.
        - Indicates positive trends in proficiency for both subjects over time.
    - Correlation Between Language and Math Progress:
        - Noticed a positive correlation between learning progress in language and math.
        - Improvement in language skills corresponds with an improvement in math skills, and vice versa.
