- 19th century, people used to work till 60, live till 65 and die. Life expectancy was lower, it was only a matter of 5 years. Now the life expectancy has increased thanks to better standard of living, better labour laws and better healthcare 
- in Bismarcks Germany, concept of a union funded pension began. Where the working population would fork out a certain percentage of their income for the older, and there was this pretext that they too would one day get older and someone else would pay the pension for them. Over time the dependency ratio skewed in the direction of the older population and suddenly it resulted in more people being dependent on pension while lesser people earning for the country and funding this pensions mechanism -- by paying tax.
- Brutish brought OPS to India -- 50% of terminal wage. 


Illusion of mortality leads to bad financial planning
Parents and children both respond to incentives. Parents see children as a means of their old-age finances as well, when they have a pension their dependency on the children reduces
Also, given that the parent has a pension and not inherited wealth to be passed on, the cholds relationship with parents also changes


Three types of pension 
- nominal - no indexation 
- inflation indexed - very expensive, now when you NPV this product this is vastly in expenditure for the pension giver, because you are bumping the pension up by the inflation rate of roughly 4% if inflation is under control' 
- wage indexing - if I'm secretory to govt and retire, through the 30 years im alive my pension will be billed up to 50% of whatever the wage of the secretary currently is bumped up to the current wage

Also one thing to note here is that pensions ara not just for that individual but also carried over to their spouse, which further increased the longevity of the pension expenditure 


However this does not apply to most of India, who doesn't get a pension. Idea of retirement only applies to people who have a retirement age, most of India does not have jobs and therefore the more relevant question is what age you would withdraw from the labour force 

So basically so far -- first evolution of pensions:people who are working are paying for those who retire and they have 4-5 years left and most likely don't get there. But as we feel up loungetivity goes up and fertility rate change. The proportion of young to old in a workforce completely changes

In an ideal world what should we hack mini that the government locked in certain the contact money per person that they can use it as a pension for a future date but instead what in what happened in India in the 80s and 90 was something called as the pay as you go pension with basically meant that there was no money login for and from future date for driver when the person required at a maximum required at that moment of time the government would obtain the money from the younger population.

Because of this situation the forces mention before or change of demographics and price of fertility rate begin to harm the financial sanity of the pension arrangement

3% of population which were essentially civil servants accounting for 68% of the GDP due to their pensions budget. This was a big problem because this was firstly not sustainable for the economy and secondary is not scale able to the larger audience because say if we were to scale it up to 30% then that would mean 680% of the total GDP
