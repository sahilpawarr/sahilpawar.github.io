Python Lists	
- Indexing lists - picking a specific observation from a list by index
	` print(courses[3])
- Index range
	`print(courses[0:4])
- Appending - to append observations to the list
	`courses = ['History' , 'Math' , 'Economics' , 'Physics']
	`courses.append('Art')`
- Inserting
	`courses = ['History' , 'Math' , 'Economics' , 'Physics'] 
	`courses.append('Art')`
- To append two lists together, use extend
	`courses = ['History' , 'Math' , 'Economics' , 'Physics'] 
	`courses2 = ['Art','Education']`
	`courses.extend(courses_2)
	`print(courses)`
- Remove
	`courses.remove = ['History']

## Binary Tree
- ##### Searching
	- More efficient way to search because if it was linear in nature then finding an element would be complex to the order of n. But if you search by a binary tree, your search complexity is effectively getting reduced by half at every stage

##### What is a rotational panel sampling design
A rotational panel sampling design is a method used in survey research to gather data from a fixed group of respondents over multiple time periods. Instead of sampling new respondents for each wave of data collection, the same group of individuals is surveyed repeatedly at regular intervals, typically over a predetermined period of time.

In this design, each member of the panel remains constant throughout the duration of the study, allowing researchers to observe changes within individuals over time. This approach can be particularly useful for tracking trends, analyzing longitudinal data, and understanding shifts in attitudes, behaviors, or other variables of interest.

##### Urban Area Sampling Methodology:
1. **Rotational Panel Scheme**: Each selected household in urban areas is visited four times. Initially, a "First Visit Schedule" is followed, followed by three periodic visits according to a "Revisit Schedule." This design ensures repeated observations of the same households over time.
2. **Sample Subdivision**: Within each stratum in urban areas, samples for a panel are drawn as two independent sub-samples. This subdivision aids in organizing and managing the sample efficiently.
3. **Rotation Scheme**: To maintain continuity and comparability, 75% of the first-stage sampling units (FSUs) are matched between two consecutive visits. This rotation scheme ensures consistency in the panel over time.
##### Rural Area Sampling Methodology:
1. **No Revisits**: Unlike urban areas, there are no revisits in the rural sampling scheme. Each selected rural household is surveyed once.
2. **Sampling Process**: Samples for rural areas are drawn randomly, with two independent sub-samples within each stratum/sub-stratum.
3. **Coverage**: In each quarter of the survey period, 25% of the FSUs of the annual allocation are covered in rural areas. This systematic coverage ensures representativeness and adequate geographical distribution.
##### Sample Size and Coverage:
1. **Total FSUs Allotted**: For the survey period from July 2022 to June 2023, a total of 12,800 FSUs were allotted at the all-India level, comprising 7,024 villages and 5,776 urban blocks.
2. **Surveyed FSUs**: Out of the allotted FSUs, 12,714 FSUs were surveyed, including 6,982 villages and 5,732 urban blocks.
3. **Households and Persons Surveyed**: The survey covered 1,01,655 households (55,844 in rural areas and 45,811 in urban areas) and 4,19,512 persons (2,43,971 in rural areas and 1,75,541 in urban areas).
##### Key Employment and Unemployment Indicators:
1. **Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)**: Defined as the percentage of persons in the population who are in the labour force (working or seeking or available for work).
2. **Worker Population Ratio (WPR)**: Defined as the percentage of employed persons in the population.
3. **Unemployment Rate (UR)**: Defined as the percentage of persons unemployed among the persons in the labour force.
