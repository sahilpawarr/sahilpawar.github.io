### Why has [[democracy]] delivered for india in the way we would think it should?

- Democracy has expanded the ability of the people to make claims on the state. However it has not expanded on the capacity of the state to deliver on those claims 
-


### [[Development Economics]] - 
- idea of poverty traps
- The initial condition that people can be so vulnerable that they cannot bootstrap their way out of the initial condition
- Contrast between public finance and development is the de facto understanding is there's a trade off between equity and efficiency. That you want to do some redistribution because you want to support the poor. 
- But that redistribution will almost always reduce efficiency in the economy, whys that? 
- Because to redistribute I need to raise taxes on the rich and that's going to reduce incentives to work
- I'm giving out something out for free which will reduce incentives to work
- Most important and underappreciated part of this Is that I'm targetting something to the poor, so by definition I need to phase out this benefit as u get richer. That phase out often creates a high marginal tax rate for the poor and this is why you have created an incentive to not work out of this poverty trap
- Well designed social program and policy intervention can not only improve equity but also improve efficiency

When people are poor govt has to do it. That's not true because when people are poor govt is also poor. Govt is nothing but the sum of the people. What is your tax base? When people are poort infact govt has less ability that's because tax to GDP ratio increases as you get richer.
