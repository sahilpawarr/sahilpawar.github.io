Learnings:
1) Evrything in life should be done with chill in head. I take unnecessary stress of very small things and even of big things.
2) People are tough to deal with, especially seniors who will always have a chip on their shoulder. Focus on letting things go and not taking things personally.
3) Let your ego go. However difficult a person is remember that you don't have to assume that you are better than them in any way. Vinit may have questioned my writing or language skills but in the end I let this get to my head and produced an output that was worse off. Let your ego go.
