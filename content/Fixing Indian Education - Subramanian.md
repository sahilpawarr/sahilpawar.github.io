- What makes India an outliner in human history
- only country in history to have universal adult franchise and democracy at such low per capita income
- Democracy before Development means for india that if u look like income dist, right skew- median income is below mean, the median voter is always going to want more redistrubution
- Most rich countries build welfare states after being rich
- how to allocte taxpayer money with public goods that create productivity vs redistrubution


Democracy should mean more decentralising, allowing the local vote for progress and development

Relationship of rising GDP to HDI


#### Declining Purchasing power over lack of supply 
[[Amartya Sen]] -- people thought that famines were because of collapse of food production. Sen said that it's not because of food production but rather because of declined purchasing power. So the problem with the famine is not that food production collapses but rather that daily wage collapses-- incomes collapse which results in famines. [[MNREGA]] scheme is a better means of social protection as what it essentially does is it guarantees protection for employment as opposed to simply providing vouchers. Idea here is that market will take care of supply if you provide it the purchasing power. 

That logic to education -- let market provide snd let state come in once needed. 

Schooling is a club good. Schools aren't trying to maximise market share.
