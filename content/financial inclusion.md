### Three challenges of Financial Inclusion are:
Access
Retention
Data Empowerment


Access:
- India in 2008, 17% of the population had bank
- The main arguement is that Penetration of financial services is directly linked to the growth in GDP
- In 2018, penetration of bank accounts had risen by 330 million. 
- This rise in a normal course of things would have taken 46 years. It happened in 10 years thanks to IndiaStack
- Three reasons for this
	- Political Will
	- Proactive Central Bank
	- [[IndiaStack]] : Indiastack has 3 parts to it:
		- **Identity Layer**: Gives every individual a unique ID and enabling them to prove "I am who i claim to be". Example: Adhaar, e-KYC, e-Sign
		- **Payments Layer**: Allowing anyone to pay anyone else. Fast and cheap. Example: Unified Payments Interface, Adhaar Payments Bridge, Adhaar enabled payments service
		- Data Empowerment: enabling secured sharing of data. Example: DigiLocker, Account Aggregator etc
