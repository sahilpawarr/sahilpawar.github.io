Imp Linked Notes: [[Harm Principle]]

-------- 



The crux of John Stuart Mill's philosophy on liberty is that individuals should have the maximum possible freedom to make their own choices, express their thoughts, and live as they wish, as long as their actions do not harm others. He believes in a balance between individual autonomy and the prevention of harm, with the ultimate goal of maximizing happiness and avoiding the tyranny of the majority. Mill refers to this ideas as the [[Harm Principle]]


- Attempt by Mill to unite the philosophy's of [[Utilitarianism]], the greatest happiness of the greatest number and Liberty - protecting individuals from the tyranny of majority
	
- Mill's observation that the political system increasingly reflected the will of the people, but lacked a substantial doctrine to protect people from a government that essentially represented their own desires.
    
- Mill's query about what prevents a majority in power from using their democratic authority to oppress the minority.
    
- Mill's core principle: "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community is to prevent harm to others.


**[[Harm Principle]]**: Mill argues that people should be free to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't harm others.
