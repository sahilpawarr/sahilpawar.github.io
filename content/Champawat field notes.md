### what's the point of getting sahmati 



Session 2: dhunaghat
- Won't get out even if they are out in the talwar dhal game
- students began to associate themselves with things that they heard, especially when they didn't know what was behind them. For example one girl said she was  called Fat and skinny and when asked what she felt was behind her she said "she didn't feel good because she thought she was fat"
- same time students who had the insecurity inhibited in them chose to mot say that other students called them that, perhaps from the fear of being laughed at. For example: a Skinnier boy who was called skinny said no one called him skinny but rather something else (possibily from the fear that others would laugh )
- The loudest of the class were the quietest during the debrief
- One student was quiet and all his peers said that he is mute and after the bodyshaming event he actually spoke
- "what does the student go through when you tease them", they kill themselves was one of the answers along with "depression me chale jayenge"
- "hame koi pharak nahi padta, hame aadat hai"
- if 5 students said they liked the bodyshaming or werent affected by it, simply by peer pressure of "how do i say that it affected me", the students who were affected also did not open up
- 

Won't another program being conducted at the same time on treatment group be a confounding variable?



### Q. How different is the overall growth of the girl child when she studies in an all girls school as compared to a co-ed school?



Meeting with the DM
- DM speaking to people from Swachatta Sarvekshan regarding opening a sanitation park in Champawat and to do projects to fund awareness related to sustainability
- Repeatedly mentioned how we should do this before the CM visit and communicate this to CM office that this work is being done in Champawat
- One point to note here is that the CM is the MLA from Champawat itself
- Reflection here is to understand the incentive structures of bureaucrats and what motivates them to take up certain projects over others

10/7
GGIC Khetikhan 
- azim premji for teacher training, 9-12 kosallam
- most teachers are transferred and classes are left vacant because of this
- principal was supportive and allowed for the sessions without any issues
- question: what role does caste play in doing favours for someone or for getting things done quicker? (Anecdote of how principal asked taruns surname and once she found some familiar connections suddenly became even more helpful )

## GIC Khetikhan: 
- computers exist but there's no one to actually teach anything related to the computer 
- low attendance despite providing evrything for free. 
- family itself stops children from going to school for reasons of maybe marriage, helping in the field, basically negligence from parents towards education because of other factors. Distance is also a factor
