### what's the point of getting sahmati 



Session 2: dhunaghat
- Won't get out even if they are out in the talwar dhal game
- students began to associate themselves with things that they heard, especially when they didn't know what was behind them. For example one girl said she was  called Fat and skinny and when asked what she felt was behind her she said "she didn't feel good because she thought she was fat"
- same time students who had the insecurity inhibited in them chose to mot say that other students called them that, perhaps from the fear of being laughed at. For example: a Skinnier boy who was called skinny said no one called him skinny but rather something else (possibily from the fear that others would laugh )
- The loudest of the class were the quietest in 

Won't another program being conducted at the same time on treatment group be a confounding variable?



### Q. How different is the overall growth of the girl child when she studies in an all girls school as compared to a co-ed school?
