While at university,  I interned for the **[Standord Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)** for the **[FUSE](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/fuse.stanford.edu)** project where I did field research and data analysis on the FWE consumption during Covid-19 and was a project intern at the **[Policy Research Organisation](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/policyresearch.in)** where I worked with historical data of Pune Municipal Corporation’s annual budgets, to offer informed policy recommendations to local policymakers. Additionally, I interned at **[Evolve](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/evolveinc.io)** for their Growth and Analytics team and as a UX researcher at **[Moonraft Innovation Labs](https://sahilpawarr.github.io/sahilpawarr111.github.io/moonraft.com)** where I worked on the strategy to execute a virtual reality metaverse project for a global tech event.
